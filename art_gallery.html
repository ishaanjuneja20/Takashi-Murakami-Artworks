                    <li>This artwork is one of the 8 artworks designed for Kanye's album MBDTF. </li>
                    <li>The cover shows West being straddled on a couch by an armless winged female, 
                        who has fearsome features and a long, spotted tail.</li>
                    <li>It was designed on 10 October, 2010. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The various covers explore themes of celebrity, fame, and Kanye's self-reflection on
                    how it has shaped him, including both the excesses and downfalls of notoriety. 
                    The album's art reflects its maximalist production and opulent aesthetic, with influences
                     from classical art, surrealism, and cubism.  </p>
